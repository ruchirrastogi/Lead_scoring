Making a Logistic Regression model for prediction of Lead conversion 
Probem Statement: 
X Education, an online education provider, generates a high volume of leads daily through various marketing channels and referrals. However, the company struggles with a low lead conversion rate of approximately 30%, meaning that only a fraction of these leads become paying customers. To enhance sales efficiency and boost conversion rates, X Education seeks to identify and prioritize the most promising leads, referred to as "Hot Leads." By focusing the sales team's efforts on these high-potential prospects and improving lead nurturing strategies, the company aims to increase the overall lead conversion rate and optimize the sales process.
